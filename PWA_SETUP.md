## 🖼️ Icons Setup (Required)

You need to create app icons. Here's how:

### Option 1: Quick Icons (Recommended)
Use a free tool to generate all sizes:
- Go to: https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Upload your logo/icon
- Download the generated package
- Place `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` in `renderer/public/`

### Option 2: Manual Creation
Create two PNG files:
- **icon-192.png** (192x192 pixels) - for most devices
- **icon-512.png** (512x512 pixels) - for high-res displays

**Design Tips:**
- Use your app logo
- Simple, recognizable design
- Works well at small sizes
- Brand colors (maroon #7f1d1d + white/black)

### Suggested Icon Design:
```
Background: Dark maroon (#7f1d1d)
Icon: White "📊" chart symbol or "T" for Tracker
Style: Minimalist, professional
```
